Extensive Nmap Tutorial

---

Introduction to Nmap

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is the most powerful and versatile network discovery and security auditing tool available today. Developed by Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon, Nmap is extensively used by network administrators and security professionals for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, monitoring host uptime, and performing security audits.

This extensive tutorial provides a detailed overview, practical usage scenarios, advanced techniques, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for ethical penetration testing.

2. Complete Overview of Nmap Scanning Types and Methods

Basic Scan:
```
nmap 192.168.1.1
```

Multiple Targets:
```
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
```

Range of IP Addresses:
```
nmap 192.168.1.1-100
```

Scan Entire Network:
```
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

Common Ports:
```
nmap -F 192.168.1.1
```

Specific Ports:
```
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
```

UDP Scan:
```
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
```

TCP SYN Scan (Stealth):
```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
```

3. Practical Scenarios with Detailed Examples

Web Server Enumeration:
```
nmap -sV -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
```

Firewall Evasion:
```
sudo nmap -Pn -f 192.168.1.1
```

Fast Discovery of Live Hosts:
```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

Full Network Audit:
```
sudo nmap -A -p1-65535 192.168.1.1
```

4. NSE Scripting Guide

Basic NSE Usage:
```
nmap --script default 192.168.1.1
```

Vulnerability Scanning:
```
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1
```

Detecting Malware on HTTP servers:
```
nmap --script http-malware-host 192.168.1.1
```

Heartbleed SSL Vulnerability Check:
```
nmap --script ssl-heartbleed -p 443 192.168.1.1
```

Script Update:
```
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```

5. Advanced Performance Optimization and Stealth Scanning

Optimizing Speed:
```
nmap -T4 192.168.1.1
```

Slow and stealthy scan:
```
nmap -T0 --scan-delay 5s 192.168.1.1
```

Timing Templates (T0 - paranoid to T5 - insane):
- `nmap -T0` very slow, undetectable.
- `nmap -T5` extremely fast, high network usage.

---

6. Real-world Troubleshooting

- **Blocked scans**:
  Use different timing options or stealth techniques.
- **Unresponsive hosts**:
  Use `-Pn` to skip host discovery.
- **Scan hangs**:
  Adjust timing (`--max-retries 2`, `--host-timeout 1m`).

Common debug commands:
```
nmap --reason -vv 192.168.1.1
```

7. Ethical and Legal Considerations

- Always have explicit written permission before scanning.
- Define the scope clearly.
- Inform network administrators beforehand to prevent disruptions.
- Secure and handle all obtained data responsibly.
