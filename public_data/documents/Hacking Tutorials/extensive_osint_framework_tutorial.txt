Introduction to the OSINT Framework

The OSINT Framework is not a tool itself, but a curated collection of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools and resources grouped by topic. It’s designed to help researchers, investigators, and penetration testers efficiently locate information about people, domains, IPs, social networks, and more.

This tutorial guides you through using the OSINT Framework effectively, applying real-world investigation techniques, and integrating external tools to automate intelligence gathering.

1. Getting Started with the OSINT Framework

Access:
- URL: https://osintframework.com
- No installation required.
- All resources are categorized and hyperlink to external tools or services.

Structure:
- Categories like: Username, Email, IP Address, Domain, Social Networks, etc.
- Tools are further grouped by function (search, analysis, enrichment).

Browser Integration:
- Use in combination with Firefox/Chrome bookmarklets or extensions for automation.

2. Key Categories and How to Use Them

Usernames:
- Discover profiles on dozens of platforms using:
  - Namechk
  - KnowEm
  - WhatsMyName

Emails:
- Validate and analyze email addresses using:
  - Hunter.io
  - HaveIBeenPwned
  - EmailRep.io

People Search:
- Search engines and social networks:
  - Pipl (commercial)
  - PeekYou
  - TruePeopleSearch

Social Networks:
- Enumerate public profiles, photos, tags:
  - Facebook Graph Search
  - LinkedIn Lookup
  - Twitter Advanced Search

Domains:
- Whois, DNS, Reverse Lookups:
  - VirusTotal
  - ViewDNS
  - DomainTools

IP Address Research:
- Locate geolocation, ASN, history:
  - Shodan
  - Censys
  - IPInfo.io

Dark Web:
- Search onion sites:
  - Ahmia
  - OnionSearch
  - TorLinks

3. Real-World Use Cases

Investigating a Target Organization:
- Start with domain → WHOIS lookup → email pattern discovery → social profile linking.

Person of Interest Search:
- Use known username → social profile correlation → location metadata from images.

Threat Attribution:
- Use IP or domain → historical data → related infrastructure → connected identities.

4. Combining the OSINT Framework with Other Tools

Automation:
- Combine framework tools with Recon-ng or SpiderFoot for scripted investigations.

Bookmarklets and Extensions:
- Use browser scripts to send usernames or emails directly to selected tools.

Exporting Results:
- While the framework itself doesn’t store data, tools it links to often support CSV, PDF, or API output for archiving.

5. Limitations and Enhancements

Framework Limits:
- Static website; links may become outdated or deprecated.
- Lacks integration or automation out-of-the-box.

Overcome with:
- Bookmark automation
- Scripting with Python (e.g., scraping public profiles, parsing metadata)
- Integration with commercial OSINT platforms for correlation

6. Ethics and Legal Considerations

- Use only public, legal, and consented information.
- Do not access or retain private data without permission.
- Respect terms of service of linked services.
- Follow GDPR and regional privacy laws when handling personal data.

7. Recommended OSINT Additions

- Maltego: Graph-based correlation
- SpiderFoot: Automated OSINT scanner
- theHarvester: Email, domain, and host collection
- Creepy: Geolocation from social media images
