Extensive Shodan Tutorial

Introduction to Shodan

Shodan is a powerful search engine for internet-connected devices. Unlike Google, which indexes websites, Shodan indexes information about the devices and services running across the internet. It's often referred to as the "search engine for hackers" due to its ability to reveal unprotected systems, IoT devices, databases, industrial control systems, and more.

This tutorial covers installation, API usage, practical search examples, filters, ethical considerations, and integration with pentesting workflows.

1. Getting Started with Shodan

Website Access:
- Visit https://www.shodan.io
- Create a free or paid account.
- Verify email and retrieve API key.

Install Shodan CLI:
```
pip install -U shodan
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
```

Basic Commands:
```
shodan info
shodan search apache
```

2. Understanding Shodan's Data

Shodan collects:
- Banner information from open ports.
- HTTP headers, SSL certificates.
- Device metadata (e.g., OS, location, hostname).
- Services (FTP, SSH, Telnet, RDP, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc.)

3. Practical Search Examples

Find Webcams:
```
shodan search "Netcam"
shodan search "webcamXP"
```

Search for FTP Servers:
```
shodan search port:21 Anonymous
```

Find SCADA/ICS Systems:
```
shodan search "port:102 SCADA"
```

Search for Specific Country:
```
shodan search apache country:DE
```

Find Exposed Databases:
```
shodan search "port:27017"  # MongoDB
shodan search "port:3306"   # MySQL
```

4. Using Filters for Precise Results

Common Filters:
- `port`: Search for specific service ports.
- `country`: 2-letter country code.
- `org`: Organization/ISP.
- `hostname`, `os`, `city`, `geo`.

Example:
```
shodan search apache country:US city:"San Francisco" port:80
```

5. Accessing Shodan API

Get Your IP Address Info:
```
shodan host 8.8.8.8
```

Automate with Python:
```python
import shodan

api = shodan.Shodan("YOUR_API_KEY")
results = api.search("nginx")

for result in results['matches']:
    print(f"{result['ip_str']}:{result['port']} - {result['data']}")
```

Search in bulk, scan custom IP ranges, or build dashboards using Shodan's rich API documentation.

6. Use Cases for Penetration Testing

Reconnaissance:
- Identify target surface before engagement.
- Find outdated software and known vulnerabilities.

Attack Surface Mapping:
- Locate related infrastructure using org/domain filters.

Incident Response:
- Monitor leaked/exposed assets.

---

7. Integration with Tools

Shodan with Metasploit:
- Plugin to directly search and import results into MSF.

Shodan with Nmap:
- Use Shodan for pre-scanning to reduce Nmap scan ranges.

Browser Extensions:
- Shodan plugin for Firefox/Chrome displays banner info while browsing.

8. Troubleshooting and Tips

Limited Results?
- Ensure API key usage is within daily quota.
- Use premium account for access to more results.

No Data Found?
- Adjust filters or keywords.
- Some services obfuscate banners or block scans.

---

9. Ethical and Legal Considerations

- Use Shodan data responsibly.
- Never target systems without authorization.
- Be cautious with SCADA/ICS systemsâ€”they are highly sensitive.
- Document all actions and obtain necessary permission.
